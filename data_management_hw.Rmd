# Demonstrate that your 3 tables are the same using your choice of methods
1. birthyear and year: each patients has only one birth year that select from their own birthdate as well as the age (for those who dead)
2. medical_id and encounter_id: return by hash function corresponding to each unique id 
3. delta: the difference between discharge date and admission date of patients, which have identical time



# Normalize the table into a patients table and an encounters table

## encounter table
```{sql connection=con}
